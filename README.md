# PairsTradingBacktest

## Personal Project

### Year
2021

### Overview
This project offers a comprehensive tool for backtesting pairs trading strategies. Users can download stock ticker data from Yahoo Finance, analyze correlations between pairs, and evaluate the effectiveness of their trading strategies over selected periods. The system allows for detailed configuration, including the selection of Z-score thresholds, strategy start and end dates, as well as a historical start date for preliminary testing.

### Features
- **Stock Data Acquisition**: Enables downloading of stock ticker data via Yahoo Finance.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Users can plot and examine the correlation between different stock pairs.
- **Customizable Strategy Testing**: Offers flexibility in setting Z-score threshold, strategy start/end dates, and a historical start date for backtesting purposes.
- **Performance Metrics Calculation**: Calculates and presents key investment performance metrics for the chosen period.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Allows users to plot and compare the ROI% of a simple buy-and-hold strategy against the pairs trading strategy over the same period.

### Functionality
The tool is designed to facilitate the empirical testing of pairs trading strategies by providing users with the ability to download historical stock data, analyze pair correlations, and execute backtests with customizable parameters. It aims to offer valuable insights into the potential profitability of pairs trading strategies through detailed performance metrics and comparative ROI analyses.

### How It Works
Users begin by downloading historical stock data for their chosen pairs via Yahoo Finance. They then proceed to analyze the correlation between these pairs and set parameters such as the Z-score threshold and the testing period (including a historical start date for initial analysis). The system calculates key performance metrics for the strategy over the selected period and enables users to compare the strategy's ROI% against a benchmark buy-and-hold strategy, providing a comprehensive view of the strategy's effectiveness.
